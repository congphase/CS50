Self-learn, first start with the Web development course

## Progress records
**Record #1**: Create Django project lecture3, application application1
<br>Get used to the Django framework, how the files/folders are structured
<br>Notice how the settings.py, urls.py, views.py, template html files are interconnected<br>

**Record #2**: Create application birthday
<br>Come up with the idea of creating an ugly redundant application where it shows if today is your birthday, based on the date users put in the request url path
<br>Request url path format required: `<host>/birthday/<mmm><dd>`, where mmm's case is ignored, i.e Jul27 or juL27 is ok

**Record #3**: Create application tasks
<br>Exposure to template inheritance, tags worth attention: `{% extends <"template-file.html"> %}`, `{% block <a-name> %}`, `{% endblock %}`
<br>Namespace used to avoid calling the unwanted functions with the same name
